# Useful web-based tools for IT and Cybersecurity
The internet is abundant with tools useful for any IT professional, but finding them can be a challenge.
I've put together a list of web-based tools that _I_ use in both my professional working life, as well as for my homelab/self-hosting hobbies. 
Tools may be a web-applicaton or a website link to a useful downloadable application. 
These may not be the best tools for each situation, but they are free, easy to use, and I've had success with each and every one of them.
